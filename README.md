# Latex-Workshop
LaTeX is an amazing tool to create documents, cvs, book chapters, and other professional-looking materials. LaTeX is based on 'WYSIWYM' (what you see is what you mean) idea, meaning you only have to focus on the contents of you document and the computer will take care of the formatting. This GitHub repositort will go over some basic prinicples:

1. How do we create a LaTeX document in Overleaf?
2. The basic structure of a LaTeX document:
	* What goes into the preamble?
	* What goes into the body?
3. Some commonly used commands you'll use in LaTeX
	* How do you write chemical formula?
	* How do you insert images/figures?
	* How do you write mathmatical formule?
	* How do you create tables?

At the end of this workshop, the goal is for you to have a starting document that you can use as a template for your own work, as well as become familiar with the [LaTeX documentation](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Creating_a_document_in_LaTeX) which covers everthing you need to know to produce your own LaTeX document.	To complete these activites, we will be using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/for/authors), which is a free, cloud-based, collaborative, writing and publishing tool based around LaTeX. To use Overleaf, you will need to create an account using you ND credentials.
