# Writing Chemical Formula

![soln2](/images/soln2.png)

1. To show charges, we simply add a `+` or `-` to the chemical name. Important thing to note: '-' and '$-$' have two different meanings, and you should use $-$ when refering to a negative sign. The equilibrium sign can also be written by replacing the one directional arrow `->` with a double arrow `<->`

2. First, we need a reversible arrow, which can be acheived by taking the double arrow `<->` and replaceing the dash with an equal sign `<=>`. Second, we can wrtie text on our arrows by following up our reversibility arrow by a set of square brackets, `[]`, and then the text we want above the arrow in curly brackets, `{}`.
