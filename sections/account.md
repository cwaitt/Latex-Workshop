# Creating an Overleaf Account
Creating an Overleaf account is fairly straight forward. You can sign up with a personal email if you wish, but it will not allow you to collaborate with others on the same project (unless you pay a modest price). If you sign up with your school credentials, you will get access to several features, including but not limited to:

1. Collaborate with 6 others on a single project

2. Sync with Dropbox and GitHub

3. View document history

4. Track changes
 
To get started, go to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/for/authors) and select register in the top right.

Then register with a personal email, or sign in via Google or an ORCID. Do not try to sign in with the institutional ID at the bottom.

Once youve created an account, you will be prompted to create your first project. **Click on projects to get to the project management page.**
