# Creating an Overleaf Account
Creating an Overleaf account is fairly straight forward. You can sign up with a personal email if you wish, but will not allow you to collaborate with others on the same project (unless you pay a modest price). If you sign up with you school credentials, you will get access to several features, including but not limited to:
	1. Collaborate with 6 others on a single project
	2. Sync with Dropbox and GitHub
	3. View document history
	4. Track changes
 
To get started, go to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/for/authors) and select register in the top right.
