# Getting Started
Once you log into Overleaf, you will see a page that looks something like this:

![Starting](/images/Getting-Started.png)

If this is your first time in Overleaf, you shouldn't have any documents here. However, as you can see, Overleaf gives you the ability to easily create new projects, as well as an organizational scheme so you can store and save older documents.

Lets start by creating a new project by selecting the green `New Project` button above. This should create a drop down menu like this:

![Blank](/images/Blank-project.png)

As you can see, you can start a project from scratch (Blank Project), or a generic Template Document, or from a preexisting project. LaTeX as has some premade templates for spefic documents such as articles, letters, CVs, etc. For now, lets start a brand new project by selecting `Blank Project`
