# Summary

This concludeds the LaTeX demonstration. Hopefully you now have a sample worksheet that you can refer to when excuting various LaTeX commands. There are many more features that we havent addressed to, which you can find in the Overleaf documentation, and I also want to note that there are many other ways to produce the same document with utilizing different sets of commands. You may find this [cheat sheet](https://wch.github.io/latexsheet/) helpful while writing your LaTeX documents in the future. If you have any suggestions, questions, or comments, feel free to reach reach out to me and I'll respond ASAP!
