# The Preamble Example

![soln1](/images/soln1.png)

We add the graphicx package through `\usepackage{graphicx}` command and we add a second line of code that tell LaTeX where to look for the images and figures we will include later. The location (or path) of the figures is set by `\graphicspath{ {./images/} }` and by adding an 'images' folder in the workspace on the left. Feel free to use any name for the folder you find appropriate.
