# Thermodynamic Table

You can combine all different types of mode while typing in tables, which can be difficult in other software. One common mistake in making tables is forgetting the `\\` to tell LaTeX to start a new row. You'll also notice that the caption is very close to the table. You can increase the spaceing between a caption and the table. [How would you do that?](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/58674/the-space-between-the-table-and-its-caption-is-very-small)
